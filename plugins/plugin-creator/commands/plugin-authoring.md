description: Load the plugin-authoring rules and apply them to subsequent plugin work in this session
---

Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/plugin-authoring.md` and apply its 10 rules to all subsequent work under `plugins/` in this session.

Steps:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/plugin-authoring.md`. If missing, tell the user and stop.
2. Print the rule titles only (one line each, numbered) so the user sees what's now in force.
3. Acknowledge in one sentence: "Plugin-authoring rules loaded. These apply to anything I write or edit under `plugins/` for the rest of this session."
4. From this point on, when creating or editing any file under `plugins/`, conform to all 10 rules. If a request would violate a rule, surface the conflict before acting.
